WDS ACF Blocks is bundled with a [Style Lint](https://stylelint.io/), [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) linting rulesets ‚Äì plus, it passes both WCAG 2.1AA and Section 508 standards out of the box.

To better manage ACF Field Groups, the plugin supports [synchronized JSON](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/synchronized-json/) for Advanced Custom Fields.

To build the production version, execute this command:

```bash
npm run build
```
### Building the blocks 
The build directory for the blocks are ignored and not being tracked by git. 
Make sure you push the build folder to your site with the help of CD/CI pipelines or manually because the blocks will not work without the build folder.

### üõ† Linting Commands

Linting rules for JavaScript and SCSS are defined in [package.json](package.json) from line number 40 to 84.

**Lint JS:**

```bash
npm run lint:js
```

**Lint SCSS:**

```bash
npm run lint:css
```

**Lint PHP:**

The PHPCS ruleset is defined in [.phpcs.xml.dist](.phpcs.xml.dist). To lint PHP via composer, run the following command:

```bash
composer run lint
```

üëâ **Important:** This plugin uses [@wordpress/scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts) to lint and compile JavaScript and SCSS.

## üìö Developer Documentation

### ‚Üí Saving ACF JSON Files

By default, saving the ACF blocks to JSON files filter is set to save to the current theme. You will need to create the `acf-json` folder on the root of your theme and transfer the existing json files in `acf-json` to that folder. You can change to save in the plugin by changing the `$path` variable to `plugin_dir_path( dirname( __FILE__ ) ) . '/acf-json';` in this line: <https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-acf-blocks/blob/main/inc/hooks.php#L27>

To know more about loading and saving of blocks in ACF JSON files, visit the [Saving and Loading Blocks](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/wds-acf-blocks/wiki/Saving-and-Loading-Blocks) section in the Wiki.

### ‚Üí Styling ACF Blocks

Styling blocks will be done in the theme and not in the plugin. The `accordion` block has a starter stylesheet that can be copied over to the theme, this contains the base style to make the accordion work and can be modified as needed. The `carousel` block is using the default `glider-js` stylesheet.
